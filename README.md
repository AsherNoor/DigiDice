# DigiDice
A Digital Dice, for fun and games

</br>Just a simple Python tool.
</br>You give it any int number, and it will "roll the dice", and give you a random number from that range.
</br>Can be something fun to incorporate into a digital game that would require Dice Rolling.
</br>Or use it to give you a random number.

<b>What You Get:</b>
</br>A "digi_dice.py" with the source code.
</br>A "Digi Dice.exe", which you can run on Windows. (No installation needed).

</br></br>
<b>Disclaimer:</b>
</br>
This is the first demo of this tool, there is no Error Handling in this version..

Hope you enjoy it.
